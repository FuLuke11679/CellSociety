## In your experience using these collections, are they hard or easy to use?

These collections are quite easy to use. Each collection interface has its own unique 
implementation with a distinct set of object classes (e.g List --> ArrayList or LinkedList).

## In your experience using these collections, do you feel mistakes are easy to avoid?

Yes, mistakes are easy to avoid.

## What methods are common to all collections (except Maps)?

Some methods that are common to all collections are add, remove, sort, reverse. 


## What methods are common to all Deques?

Methods that are common to all Deques include: push_front(), push_back(), pop_front(), pop_back(),
front(), back(), empty(), size(). 


## What is the purpose of each interface implemented by LinkedList?

LinkedList implements the List and Queue, Deque interfaces. The purpose of the List implementation
is to provide the user with a standard LinkedList. The purpose of the Queue, Deque implementations is to
provide the user with a LinkedList that supports queueing/dequeing. 

## How many different implementations are there for a Set?

3—HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet.

## What is the purpose of each superclass of PriorityQueue?

Collection interface—basic functionality for adding/removing

Queue interface—allows FIFO behavior, offer(), pull(), peek() methods

## What is the purpose of the Collections utility class?

The Collections utility class is the API for working with objects that are part
of the collections framework. For example, binary_search, min, max, sort, add_all, copy.
