This project implements a cellular automata simulator.

### Timeline

 * Start Date: 2/2/2024

 * Finish Date: 2/4/2024

 * Hours Spent: 15



### Attributions

 * Resources used for learning (including AI assistance)
 
 * Resources used directly (including AI assistance)


### Running the Program

 * Main class:

Main.java

 * Data files needed: 

At least one of the following:
- Fire1.xml
- Fire2.xml
- Fire3.xml
- Fire4.xml
- Fire5.xml
- GameOfLife5.xml
- GameOfLife_1.xml
- GameOfLife_2.xml
- GameOfLife_3.xml
- GameOfLife_4.xml
- Percolation1.xml
- Percolation2.xml
- Percolation3.xml
- Simple.xml

 * Interesting data files:

- Fire4.xml
- Percolation 2.xml

 * Key/Mouse inputs:

- Click for buttons

### Notes/Assumptions

 * Assumptions or Simplifications:

We assumed there was no controller needed. Therefore, all of the back end and front end communication
occurs in the main method. Additionally, the front end does not use any CSS.

 * Known Bugs:

None

 * Features implemented:

- Simulation: Conway’s Game of Life
- Simulation: Percolation
- Simulation: Spreading of Fire
- Test Configurations: Game of Life Known Patterns
- XML-Based Simulation Configuration
- Cell Grid View
- Load New Configuration File
- Start Simulation
- Pause Simulation
- Simulation Speed Adjustment


 * Features unimplemented:

- Simulation: Schelling’s Model of Segregation
- Simulation: Wa-Tor World
- Display Simulation Information
- Save Simulation State as XML
- Edit Simulation Save
- Reset and Clear Grid

 * Noteworthy Features:

None

### Assignment Impressions

This assignment is great for learning about encapsulation and good design principles. This was also
our first time working with a front and back end system (more complex than breakout) so it was tricky to 
tie the two together. We would like to refactor this in the future.
